# MonkeGamemodes
Adds multiple custom gamemodes to the VR game *Gorilla Tag*.  
Each gamemode is implemented as its own standalone mod.

## Gamemodes
### Team Infection
Two teams (Red & Blue) compete to convert all other players to their side.   
Tag a player on the opposing team to convert them to your team.   
The first team to turn the entire lobby to their side wins.

### Hot Potato
1-3 players start with a hot potato (depends on how many people are in the room).   
You must pass the hot potato to another player in order to avoid being blown up after 30 seconds.
